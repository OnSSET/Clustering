## Setting up the environment & running the model

**Install from GitHub**

Download repository directly or clone it to you designated local directory using:

```
git clone https://github.com/babakkhavari/Clustering.git
```

**Requirements**

The clustering module (as well as all supporting scripts in this repo) have been developed in Python 3. We recommend installing [Anaconda's free distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) as suited for your operating system. 

Once installed, open anaconda prompt and move to your local "clustering" directory using:

```
> cd ..\clustering
```

In order to be able to run the clustering tool (main.ipynb and funcs.ipynb) you have to install all necessary packages. "full_project.yml" contains all of these and can be easily set up by creating a new virtual environment using:

```
conda env create --name clustering --file full_project.yml
```

This might take some time. When complete, activate the virtual environment using:

```
conda activate clustering
```

With the environment activated, you can now move to the clustering directory and start a "jupyter notebook" session by simply typing:

```
..\clustering> jupyter notebook 
```
